 <summary><h3> ü™Ñ My coding Journey </h3></summary>
   It all strated at the end of 10th grade , after remembering gud old days of playing Project IGI, jinja ninja on dish TV , once upon a week computer practical classes that was the most exciting part of school life. I had thus decided to take up Computer science in +2 pre university. Obviously having no idea as to what was a programing language was, i used to read glossary in a dictionary to understand abbrevations and important components of the computer (looking back i laugh at how naive i was)...Then on going to college opened doors to the realm of programing languages, lucky for me i had the most coolest computer teacher i could ever ask for . from traditional history of C , basic programuing rules,OOP Concepts or syntax as he would mention it. It was unimaginable for me grasp in one goe (truly a code Shock...!! no pun intended) ...slowly it became fascinating ...then on from doing regular academic programing , me and my friend would often do side quests by programing other subject formulas like Kinematic equation to find the hieght of the bridge , person etc just by inputting the speed and the trignometric equation making a virtual saxtent by estuimating the distance by inputing the angle of elevation...our teacher although didnt quite understand these formulas, did actually acknowledge our efforts and gave quite the feedback and praise. Then comes the gud old engineering days , being hungry for freedom rather than knowledgge does have its toll , although my coding passion wasnt exausted yet ...still it wasnt at great pace, i did learn gud amount of languages :C, C++, HTML, CSS, PhP, Python , Java(i hated this),AI ML , Networking, Computer Architecture, Advanced Calculus, softwares :X - Code, Android Studio , Linux Cmd Line Interface , basics of Raspberry Pi my only regret was that unlike Pu where content was low yet hunger to learn was more, here it was quite the opposite. That aside after college i went on meditative journey learning Unity Game Engine, .NET ASP , Advanced JavScript, revisting MySql and API's , also grinding my way towards Adobe Illustrator , Figma, AutoDesk Maya, Rive 2D with the to create Indie games someday.
  ### Overall the SilverLining would be : ###
## SOMETIMES I WISH I CONTINUED BEING A NERD , AND HADN'T SETTLED FOR FREEDOM .THEN AGAIN COLLEGE MEMORIES CAN NEVER BE RE-LIVED...!!  ##
